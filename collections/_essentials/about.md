# About

ðŸ‘‹ Hello there! We are the [Swissup team](https://github.com/swissup) and we develop
top-notch Magento modules and themes.

Breeze --- is our replacement of the classic Luma frontend. It consists from
two parts:

 -  **Breeze Module** --- a drop-in replacement of Magento js stack. Take a look at
    [breeze.swissupdemo.com](https://breeze.swissupdemo.com/) --- it's a
    working Luma theme without most of javascript code.
 -  **Breeze Blank Theme** --- minimalistic starter theme [breeze.swissupdemo.com](https://breeze.swissupdemo.com/breeze_blank)  with built-in
    critical and deferred CSS splitting, sharp and cristal clear images for all devices, RTL direction support, keyboard navigation friendly.

Proceed to the [next page](/screenshots) to see all available Breeze themes
and their demo's.

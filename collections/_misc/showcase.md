## Partial Breeze experience

These stores use **Breeze Module** or **Breeze Theme** only.

**[Spotix.com](https://www.spotix.com/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}**

Spotix uses custom theme based on Argento Stripes theme. Super heavy site that
still needs a lot of performance improvements because of unbelievable amount
of third-party scripts and styles.

**[Justrite.com](https://www.justrite.com/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}**

Another one goliath. Fully custom theme made by SheroCommerce. SheroCommerce
made a titanic work to integrate tons of custom logic with Breeze JS stack.

<!-- **[BGGTH.com](https://bggth.com/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}**

Very unexpected Breeze usage. This store uses custom theme based on Breeze Blank,
but JS stack is disabled in favor of classic Luma stack: jQuery, RequireJS, etc.
We do hope it's a temporary decision. -->

**Argento based stores**

The next sites are using various Argento themes. Moving to BreezeJS wasn't a
challenge for these sites, since all Argento modules are Breeze-friendly out of
the box. 1.5-2.5x perfomance boost was made in just a few clicks!

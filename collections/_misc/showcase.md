# Showcase

You can find examples of Breeze-powered stores on this page. Some of them are
Luma-based, some use full Breeze experience. We split them into separate groups
for you.

## Full Breeze experience

These stores use both **Breeze Module** and **Breeze Theme**.

**[Altitec.no](https://altitec.no/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}**

This store uses customized Breeze Evolution theme with some extra features:

 -  Heavily customized menu is moved at the very top of the site.
 -  Blazing fast search results powered by custom search module.
 -  Quick buy button at product page powered by Vipps payment.
 -  Firecheckout as a checkout page.

**[PremiumKilts.com](https://premiumkilts.com/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}**

Pure Breeze Evolution theme without customizations.

 -  NavigationPro module is used to create large menu dropdowns.

**[ImpressionsLast.com](https://impressionslast.com/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}**

Breeze Evolution theme with beautiful brown color scheme.

 -  Product page is using powerful product personalization module.
 -  Firecheckout as a checkout page.

**[Kolarz.com.pl](https://kolarz.com.pl/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}**

Another pure Breeze Evolution store with additional modules:

 -  Tawk chat module.
 -  Product badges powered by ProLabels module.
 -  SoldTogehter blocks at product pages.
 -  Firecheckout as a checkout page.

## Partial Breeze experience

These stores use **Breeze Module** or **Breeze Theme** only.

**[Spotix.com](https://www.spotix.com/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}**

Spotix uses custom theme based on Argento Stripes theme. Super heavy site that
still needs a lot of performance improvements because of unbelievable amount
of third-party scripts and styles.

**[Justrite.com](https://www.justrite.com/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}**

Another one goliath. Fully custom theme made by SheroCommerce. SheroCommerce
made a titanic work to integrate tons of custom logic with Breeze JS stack.

**[BGGTH.com](https://bggth.com/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}**

Very unexpected Breeze usage. This store uses custom theme based on Breeze Blank,
but JS stack is disabled in favor of classic Luma stack: jQuery, RequireJS, etc.
We do hope it's a temporary decision.

**Argento based stores**

The next sites are using various Argento themes. Moving to BreezeJS wasn't a
challenge for these sites, since all Argento modules are Breeze-friendly out of
the box. 1.5-2.5x perfomance boost was made in just a few clicks!
